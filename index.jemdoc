I am a master's student at McGill University, where I'm very fortunate to be advised by [https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~yueli/ Prof. Yue Li]. Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from [https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/ Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences] (a.k.a, Yao Class) at Tsinghua University.

My research interests include *computational healthcare*, *biomedical knowledge graph*, and *machine learning* (especially *graph representation learning* and *topic modeling*).

At Tsinghua University, I was first introduced to computational biology research by [https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/zengjy/ Prof. Jianyang Zeng] and worked on *T cell receptor $\alpha, \beta$-chain pairing*. During the Spring of 2019, I was visiting CMU, working under the supervision of [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jianma/index.html Prof. Jian Ma] on *hypergraph learning* and *Hi-C data analysis*. My bachelor's thesis advisor is [http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/member/xzhang/XZhang_English.html Prof. Xuegong Zhang].
